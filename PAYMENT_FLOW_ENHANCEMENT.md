# Payment Flow Enhancement: ProductPurchase & Invoice Population

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced payment verification flow that ensures proper data population in the `ProductPurchase` and `Invoice` tables after successful payment verification. The enhancement maintains data integrity across orders, purchases, and invoices for comprehensive business tracking.

## Problem Statement

Previously, the payment verification process only updated order status and inventory but didn't populate the `ProductPurchase` and `Invoice` tables. This created gaps in:

- Business analytics and reporting
- Invoice generation for sellers
- Purchase history tracking  
- Revenue calculations for the dashboard
- Audit trail for transactions

## Solution Architecture

### Enhanced Payment Flow

The new flow ensures that after successful payment verification, the system creates:

1. **ProductPurchase Records** - One for each item in the order
2. **Invoice Records** - One invoice per ProductPurchase  
3. **SellerAnalytics Updates** - Real-time seller performance metrics

                                    ├─ Invoice Generation  
                                    │
                                    ├─ SellerAnalytics Update
                                    │
                                    └─ Commission Processing
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Payment Verification Enhancement

**File**: `app/routes/orders.py` - `verify_payment()` function

**New Logic Added**:
- Creates ProductPurchase record for each OrderItem
- Generates unique invoice for each purchase
- Updates seller analytics in real-time
- Maintains proper relationships between entities

### 2. Webhook Enhancement  

**File**: `app/routes/webhooks.py` - `handle_product_purchase()` function

**Enhancement**:
- Added invoice creation for webhook-based purchases
- Ensures consistent data population across payment methods
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 3. Data Model Relationships

```
Order (1) ──── OrderItem (N)
                    │
                    │ (creates)
                    ↓
              ProductPurchase (1) ──── Invoice (1)
                    │
                    │ (updates)  
                    ↓
              SellerAnalytics (1)
```

## Database Schema Integration

**Fields Populated**:
```sql
- id: UUID (generated)
- userId: From order
- email: From current_user
- productId: From order item
- paymentGateway: "PAYSTACK"  
- customerName: From shipping address
- customerPhone: From shipping address
- shippingAddress: JSON from order
- quantity: From order item
- totalAmount: price × quantity
- unitPrice: From order item
- createdAt: Current timestamp
- updatedAt: Current timestamp
```

### Invoice Table Population

**Fields Populated**:
```sql
- id: UUID (generated)
- invoiceNumber: INV-{timestamp}-{purchaseId}
- purchaseId: Links to ProductPurchase
- sellerId: From order item
- customerEmail: From current_user
- customerName: From shipping address
- subtotal: Item total
- tax: 0.00 (configurable)
- discount: 0.00 (configurable)  
- total: Item total
- currency: From order
- status: "PAID" (verified payment)
- sentAt: Current timestamp
- paidAt: Current timestamp
- createdAt: Current timestamp
- updatedAt: Current timestamp
```

## Code Examples

### Payment Verification Integration

```python
# Extract customer details
shipping_address = order.get("shippingAddress", {})
customer_name = shipping_address.get("fullName", "") if isinstance(shipping_address, dict) else f"Customer {order['userId'][:8]}"

# Create ProductPurchase for each item
for item in order["items"]:
    purchase_data = {
        "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "userId": order["userId"],
        "email": current_user.get("email", ""),
        "productId": item["productId"],
        "paymentGateway": "PAYSTACK",
        "quantity": item["quantity"],
        "totalAmount": float(Decimal(str(item["price"])) * item["quantity"]),
        "unitPrice": float(item["price"]),
        "customerName": customer_name,
        "customerPhone": customer_phone,
        "shippingAddress": shipping_address,
        "createdAt": now.isoformat(),
        "updatedAt": now.isoformat(),
    }
    
    purchase_response = supabase.table("ProductPurchase").insert(purchase_data).execute()
    
    # Create corresponding invoice
    if purchase_response.data:
        purchase = purchase_response.data[0]
        invoice_data = {
            "invoiceNumber": f"INV-{int(datetime.now().timestamp())}-{purchase['id'][:8]}",
            "purchaseId": purchase["id"], 
            "sellerId": item["sellerId"],
            "customerEmail": current_user.get("email", ""),
            "total": float(item["price"]) * item["quantity"],
            "status": "PAID"
        }
        supabase.table("Invoice").insert(invoice_data).execute()
```

### Webhook Integration

```python 
# In handle_product_purchase function
purchase_data = {
    "userId": metadata.userId,
    "productId": metadata.productId,
    "paymentGateway": "PAYSTACK",
    "quantity": 1,
    "totalAmount": total_amount,
    "unitPrice": unit_price_in_cedis,
}

purchase = supabase.table("ProductPurchase").insert(purchase_data).execute()

# Create invoice
invoice_data = {
    "invoiceNumber": f"INV-{int(datetime.utcnow().timestamp())}-{purchase['id'][:8]}",
    "purchaseId": purchase["id"],
    "sellerId": product_data["sellerId"],
    "total": total_amount,
    "status": "PAID"
}
supabase.table("Invoice").insert(invoice_data).execute()
```

## Benefits of Enhancement
